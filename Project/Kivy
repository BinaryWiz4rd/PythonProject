To create this project, we used Kivy, and KivyMD:

Kivy is a Python module, cross-platform compatible GUI development kit.

It allows us to creates graphical that works on Windows, Mac, Linus, iOS, and Android
(Android Studio could never). ==> It means that our application is scalable for all those platforms.

https://kivy.org/doc/stable/gettingstarted/installation.html

In windows, we perform the following installations to make it work:

python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools
python -m pip install docutils pygments pypiwin32 kivy.deps.sdl2 kivy.deps.glew
python -m pip install kivy.deps.gstreamer
python -m pip install kivy.deps.angle
python -m pip install pygame
python -m pip install kivy

pip install kivymd ==> KivyMD is used for aesthetical properties
